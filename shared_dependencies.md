The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Next.js**: This is the main framework used for building the application. It is used in all the files for server-side rendering and routing.

2. **React**: Next.js is built on top of React, so all the components (Header.tsx, Footer.tsx, index.tsx, _app.tsx, _document.tsx) will use React for defining components and managing state.

3. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used in all the .tsx files for type checking and improved developer experience. The tsconfig.json file is the configuration file for TypeScript.

4. **CSS Modules**: The CSS Modules methodology is used in the Home.module.css file for styling the components. This methodology ensures that all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default.

5. **Public Assets**: The public folder is a special directory where static assets (favicon.ico, vercel.svg) can be served from. These assets can be referenced in any of the .tsx files.

6. **Package.json**: This file contains the list of project dependencies and scripts. All the dependencies (Next.js, React, TypeScript) are listed here.

7. **.next/config.js**: This is the configuration file for Next.js. It can be used to customize the behavior of Next.js.

8. **DOM Elements**: The id names of DOM elements that JavaScript functions will use are shared across the .tsx files. For example, the Header and Footer components might be used in multiple pages.

9. **Function Names**: Function names are shared across the .tsx files. For example, a function defined in _app.tsx might be used in other pages or components.

10. **Message Names**: If the application uses a messaging system (like Redux or Context API), the names of the messages (actions) are shared across the .tsx files.
